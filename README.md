## Introduction

Traditionally, a hotel property management system is defined as a system that enables a hotel or group of hotels to manage front-office capabilities, such as booking reservations, guest check-in/check-out, room assignment, managing room rates, and billing.

We have tried our best to simplify the complicated process of designing and developing a Hotel Management System using a structured, modular technique and a menu-oriented interface.
